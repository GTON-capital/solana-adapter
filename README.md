# Hello world on Solana

This project demonstrates how to use the [Solana Javascript
API](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js) to build, deploy, and
interact with programs on the Solana blockchain.

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain hello world program
* A client that can send a "hello" to an account and get back the number of
  times "hello" has been sent

## Quick Start

[![Open in
Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld)

If you decide to open in Gitpod then refer to
[README-gitpod.md](README-gitpod.md), otherwise continue reading.

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example, depending
on your OS, they may already be installed:

- Install node
- Install npm
- Install the latest Rust stable from https://rustup.rs/
- Install Solana v1.5.8 or later from
  https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

If this is your first time using Rust, these [Installation
Notes](README-installation-notes.md) might be helpful.

### Start local Solana cluster

This example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

Enable on-chain program logs:
```bash
$ export RUST_LOG=solana_runtime::system_instruction_processor=trace,solana_runtime::message_processor=debug,solana_bpf_loader=debug,solana_rbpf=debug
```

Start a local Solana cluster:
```bash
$ solana-test-validator --log
```
**WARNING: `solana-test-validator` is not currently available for native Windows.  Try using WSL, or switch to Linux or macOS**

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Build the on-chain program

There is both a Rust and C version of the on-chain program, whichever is built
last will be the one used when running the example.

```bash
$ npm run build:program-rust
```

```bash
$ npm run build:program-c
```

### Run the client

```bash
$ npm run start
```

### Expected output

Public key values will differ:

```bash
Lets say hello to a Solana account...
Connection to cluster established: http://localhost:8899 { solana-core: 1.1.2 }
Loading hello world program...
Program loaded to account 47bZX1D1tdmw3KWTo5MfBrAwwHBJQQzQL4VnNGT7HtyQ
Creating account Eys1jdLHdZ2AE56QAKpfadbjziMZ6NAvpL7qsdtM6sbk to say hello to
Saying hello to Eys1jdLHdZ2AE56QAKpfadbjziMZ6NAvpL7qsdtM6sbk
Eys1jdLHdZ2AE56QAKpfadbjziMZ6NAvpL7qsdtM6sbk has been greeted 1 times
Success
```

#### Not seeing the expected output?

- Ensure you've [started the local cluster](#start-local-solana-cluster) and
  [built the on-chain program](#build-the-on-chain-program).
- The cluster output log should include program log messages that indicate why
  the program failed.
  - `program log: <message>`
- Inspect the Solana cluster logs looking for any failed transactions or failed
  on-chain programs
  - Expand the log filter and restart the cluster to see more detail
    - ```bash
      $ export RUST_LOG=solana_runtime::native_loader=trace,solana_runtime::system_instruction_processor=trace,solana_runtime::bank=debug,solana_bpf_loader=debug,solana_rbpf=debug
      $ solana-test-validator --log

### Customizing the Program

To customize the example, make changes to the files under `/src`.  If you change
any files under `/src/program-rust` or `/src/program-c` you will need to
[rebuild the on-chain program](#build-the-on-chain-program)

Now when you rerun `npm run start`, you should see the results of your changes.

## Learn about Solana

More information about how Solana works is available in the [Solana
documentation](https://docs.solana.com/) and all the source code is available on
[github](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana)

## Learn about the client

The client in this example is written in JavaScript using:
- [Solana web3.js SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
- [Solana web3 API](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js)

### Entrypoint

The [client's
entrypoint](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/e936ab42e168f1939df0164d5996adf9ca635bd0/src/client/main.js#L14)
does four things

### Establish a connection to the cluster

The client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling
[`establishConnection`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/e936ab42e168f1939df0164d5996adf9ca635bd0/src/client/hello_world.js#L45).

### Load the helloworld on-chain program if not already loaded

The process of loading a program on the cluster includes storing the shared
object's bytes in a Solana account's data vector and marking the account
executable.

The client loads the program by calling
[`loadProgram`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/e936ab42e168f1939df0164d5996adf9ca635bd0/src/client/hello_world.js#L54).
The first time `loadProgram` is called, the client:

- Reads the shared object from the file system
- Calculates the fees associated with loading the program
- Airdrops lamports to a payer account to pay for the load
- Loads the program via the Solana web3.js function
  ['BPFLoader.load']([TODO](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/37d57926b9dba05d1ad505d4fd39d061030e2e87/src/bpf-loader.js#L36))
- Creates a new "greeter" account that will be used in the "Hello" transaction
- Records the [public
  key](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js/blob/37d57926b9dba05d1ad505d4fd39d061030e2e87/src/publickey.js#L10)
  of both the loaded helloworld program and the "greeter" account in a config
  file.  Repeated calls to the client will refer to the same loaded program and
  "greeter" account.  (To force the reload of the program issue `npm
  clean:store`)

### Send a "Hello" transaction to the on-chain program

The client then constructs and sends a "Hello" transaction to the program by
calling
[`sayHello`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/e936ab42e168f1939df0164d5996adf9ca635bd0/src/client/hello_world.js#L121).
The transaction contains a single very simple instruction that primarily carries
the public key of the helloworld program account to call and the "greeter"
account to which the client wishes to say "Hello" to.

### Query the Solana account used in the "Hello" transaction

Each time the client says "Hello" to an account, the program increments a
numerical count in the "greeter" account's data.  The client queries the
"greeter" account's data to discover the current number of times the account has
been greeted by calling
[`reportHellos`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/e936ab42e168f1939df0164d5996adf9ca635bd0/src/client/hello_world.js#L138.)

## Learn about the on-chain program

The [on-chain helloworld program](/src/program-rust/Cargo.toml) is a Rust program
compiled to [Berkley Packet Format
(BPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) and stored as an
[Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) shared
object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

The program is written using:
- [Solana Rust SDK](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/sdk)

### Programming on Solana

To learn more about Solana programming model refer to the [Programming Model
Overview](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview).

To learn more about developing programs on Solana refer to the [Deployed
Programs
Overview](https://docs.solana.com/developing/deployed-programs/overview)

## Pointing to a public Solana cluster

Solana maintains three public clusters:
- `devnet` - Development cluster with airdrops enabled
- `testnet` - Tour De Sol test cluster without airdrops enabled
- `mainnet-beta` -  Main cluster

Use npm scripts to configure which cluster.

To point to `devnet`:
```bash
$ npm run cluster:devnet
```

To point back to the local cluster:
```bash
$ npm run cluster:localnet
```

## Expand your skills with advanced examples

There is lots more to learn; The following examples demonstrate more advanced
features like custom errors, advanced account handling, suggestions for data
serialization, benchmarking, etc...
